        <h4 class="color1">FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER</h4>
        <p>I'm a software development student at Trybe, based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. What motivates me towards web development is 
        the opportunity to change the way people interact with technology in a daily basis, improving their experience 
        by a well developed and designed product.</p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            My front-end skills as an developer <i> will </i> go from HTML, <strong>CSS</strong>, JavaScript and React. 
            I am really curious about swift, tho.
            As a full-stack web developer, 
            I will also learn: Docker, SQL, Node.js, 
            TypeScript, MongoDB, Phyton and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a hardworking <i>woman in technology</i>, I work towards 
            giving my best at every task, to reasure me and
            the team I work with will achieve the best outcome possible.
        </p>

        <h4>some of my skills are:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication: I work well in teams.</li>
            <li> <strong>I am an artis</strong> (you can check out my work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/calvitoria.art/" target="_blank">here</a>)- therefore, I love to build unique and stylish projects!</li>
            <li>I learned so far: Git, GitHub, Bash, HTML and a bit of CSS and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>I always think how others mihgt respont to my interactions and statements, not just in order to build smart pieces of technology, but because I believe that is 
                an important thing when communicating with people from different backgrounds than I. 
            </li>
            <li>I love having my workspace well organized, as the other parts of my life. Planning is like a hobby for me.</li>

       <strong>disclamer:</strong> The following statements are part 'fictional', because I've never actually worked with Web Dev, 
       but I will 100% work around these 4 'pillars'. For me it is negotiable. But yeah, just so you know, you entered a exercise-web-page :) 
       feel free to give feedbacks! they will help me a lot!

        <H4>Responsive</H4>
        <p> All projects that I make are responsive. 
            That means that they will perfectly work. 
            At any device. Big, Small, you name it.
        </p>

        <H4>Comunication</H4>
        <p> In my opinion, communication is one of the 
            most crucial skills one might need. Everything
            is easier and more enjoyable when all the 
            parts can communicate. That's why I will 
            always be as transparent and clear as I can.

        <H4>Easy to use</H4>
        <p> Accessibility is an important thing to consider 
            while coding and creating new amazing things! 
            That's why all my products are based in a simple 
            -but not boring- design. As an front-end developer, 
            you must apply good UI and UX techniques to your 
            page or application.

        <H4>A -true- clichÃª</H4>
        <p> I know, talking about how much love you put into
            your work is a big clichÃª, but it is true. 
            In every project I get to put my hands on, it's an
            opportunity to do my best, to help other people
            achieve their goals. I do think that's beautiful, 
            and guess what? <strong>I love it!</strong>
